    "# Regression Analysis - A Plan for This Lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to learn a little bit about traditional statistical analyses.  The crucial piece here is not that you to fully understand all of traditional statistics -- that's another class -- but rather to gain a sense of what it can (and more importantly, what it *can not*) do.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional statistical analyses are how many people do exploratory research.  But do not make the classic research mistake of thinking that patterns that you find in your data represent reality. Regression analyses are powerful, but inept use of regressions also lays the groundwork for much of the replication crisis currently engulfing the social sciences.  If you haven't heard about [data dredging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging), p-hacking and over-fitting, get used to those terms.  They are bane of modern research existence, and they are still really, really widespread.  More than that, even when using the best machine learning practices, people make all kinds of mistakes about what data should and should not be included in their particular application.  We'll talk a bit more about that as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "That plan for this lesson is to get some data sets loaded, make sure they're all properly geocoded and merged, and then look for patterns in the data.  We'll find one -- but it might not be as simple as it appears at first. \n",

    "# automating the data dredge\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes -- not when trying to make any claims about causation -- but sometimes when doing exploratory analyses, you might just want to automate your data dredging workflow.  Many statistical packages actually have something called \"stepwise regression\" that does this for the researcher.  Stepwise regression is meant to be exploratory, but because almost no one who publishes results pre-registers their experiments it has become a mainstay of the academic publishing dystopia.  People get data, run a bazillion transformations and interactions, then run stepwise regression to maximize their R-squared, increase their confidence intervals, and come out with a totally confabulated hypothesis that their analysis \"tests\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "In future weeks, we'll start to see how this kind of automation, when done correctly, can be a good thing.  But for now, let's just see how we would do this in Python, which does not have a package to do this.  We'll just make a simple function that can iterate through a fully interacted model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to understand all the code to know this: many researchers do things like this all the time, building up extremely fragile models that increase the fit fo the their model, but have no theory and are never really thought through.  Needless to say, you shouldn't do it.  But with that advice, let's do something really stupid, so we can learn a bit about how sci-kit learn work later on. "
